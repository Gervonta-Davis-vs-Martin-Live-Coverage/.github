Davis vs. Martin Preview
Date: Saturday, June 15
Time: 11 p.m. ET / 8 p.m. PT
Location: MGM Grand Garden Arena (Las Vegas, Nevada)
Moneyline: Davis -700, Martin +480

Davis currently holds the WBA lightweight title and has a longer track record than Martin, which explains why he’s such a heavy favorite here.

Davis defeated Ryan Garcia with a seventh-round body shot in his most recent fight last April, which led to him being named the face of boxing after the fight. He’s 29-0 in his career with all but two of those wins coming via knockout.

As for Martin, he’s getting his first title shot after defeating Artem Harutyunyan by unanimous decision last July. The 29-year-old will have his work cut out for him against Davis, however, who is more experienced, more powerful and considered the more complete fighter.

Given his advantages in this matchup, Davis is a heavy betting favorite at most online sportsbooks.

The simplest bet to make for this fight is on the moneyline. That’s a wager on which fighter will win, regardless of the method of victory or length of the fight.

Davis is a huge -700 favorite on the moneyline at FanDuel, which means that you’d have to wager $700 to win $100. Martin is a +480 underdog, so you’d win $480 if your $100 bet on him cashes.

There’s also a 3-way moneyline where Davis is -600, Martin is +500 and a draw is +2000.

Another straightforward bet is the Over/Under on the total number of rounds the fight will last, although those odds haven’t been released yet.

You can also bet on the method of victory as a prop bet. Davis winning by KO/TKO has the shortest odds at -175, while Davis winning by points or decision is +300. Martin’s odds for those outcomes are much longer at +750 and +1400, respectively.

Bettors can also wager on whether the fight will go the distance. The fight ending early has -215 odds compared to +164 odds for the fight to go the distance, so oddsmakers are expecting a KO/TKO/DQ.

Lastly, you can combine multiple wagers into a parlay to get longer odds and take a shot at a higher payout. For example, you can bet on a fighter to win and for the match to go over or under a certain number of rounds.

Here are the odds for the full fight card, including Davis versus Martin.
